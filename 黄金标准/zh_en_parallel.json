Accompanying the P.R.C. from its founding to its prosperity, from ruins to peace and bountiful harvests, these works-with their distinctive artistic language and vibrant pictorial atmo- sphere-serve as visual representations, records, and artistic carriers of rural development in our era. This exhibition, jointly organized by the Public Service Department of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the National Museum of China, features 278 selected works submitted from various regions and evaluated by experts, along with over 70 classic pieces, documents and archival sets. Themed \"Rural Vitality · Spirit of the Times,' the exhibition is divided into three sections: \"Narrating Folklore,\"Visions of Agrarian Life, and\"Embracing RenewalIt includes lively depictions of dragon and lion dances welcoming the New Year, scenes of autumn harvests and winter fishing, and portray- als of the vibrant new landscape of rural revitalization. From the perspectives of daily customs, productive labor, and contemporary development, the exhibition presents the current state of farm- ers' painting in the new era, showcasing the progress of China's rural areas and the lives of its people. The countryside is the wellspring of inspiration for these artists. The unpretentious character and resilient optimism of China's farmers are channeled into the artworks' rustic forms, brilliant colors, and heartfelt passion. In painting, these creators forge a profound connection between self, home- town, and nation. They render in a world of vivid hues their deep attachment to the land, their love for their country, and their bright aspirations for the future. We sincerely hope that in these bold and sincere creations, you will feel the vibrant pulse of our era and be inspired by the powerful story of China's ruralrevitalization."

Gold, introduced from beyond China's borders, was continually reshaped through encounters and integrations with indigenous aesthetics, techniques, cultural practices, and histories, ultimately giving rise to the uniquely resplendenttraditionof Chinesegoldwork. The objects on view-varied in motif, exquisite in craftsmanship, and distinctive in artistic style-open for us a “golden gateway\" into history.As tangible materials, they invite us to deepen our understanding of regional cultures and of the processes of interaction and fusion between China and the wider world. At the same time, they affirm how Chinese civilization, through openness and innovation, constant adaptation, and an embrace of diversity, has continued to renew and enrich itself across the ages"
